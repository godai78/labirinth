This is a GB Studio adventure-type game I'm working on slowly in my free time with GB Studio by Chris Maltby (https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio). Not sure where this will get me and how long will it take or how long the whole game would be, but this is fun to do and that's basically all that matters now.

There is a plan to redo all the graphics and add new music, right now I reuse some of GB Studio's own images + some free assets. When or even if this shall be accomplished is not known now.

You can download the Game Boy from or play the game online on itch.io: https://godai78.itch.io/labirinth
